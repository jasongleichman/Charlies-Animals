    name: 'Fennec Fox',
    facts: [
      `Fennec foxes are the smallest canid (dog family) in the world.`,
      `Their 6-inch-long ears (a quarter of their body length!) radiate body heat to stay cool.`,
      `They have thick fur on their paw pads, like snowshoes, to walk on hot desert sand.`,
      `They can purr like a house cat when they are content.`,
      `They can jump over 3 feet high from a standing position.`,
      `They are so adapted to the desert, they can get all their water just from eating plants and insects.`,
      `A group of foxes is called a "skulk" or a "leash".`,
      `They are nocturnal and have excellent night vision, thanks to a reflective layer called the "tapetum lucidum".`,
      `They live in complex dens with multiple entrances, sometimes housing up to 10 foxes.`,
      `Their kidneys are specially adapted to conserve water in their harsh environment.`

    name: 'Axolotl',
    facts: [
      `Axolotls are "neotenic," meaning they stay in their larval (water) form for their whole lives.`,
      `They can regenerate complex limbs, their spinal cord, their jaw, and even parts of their brain!`,
      `They can even accept transplanted limbs from other axolotls without rejection.`,
      `Their feathery-looking "gills" are external and are used to breathe underwater.`,
      `Their name comes from the Aztec god Xolotl, the god of fire, lightning, and deformations.`,
      `They hunt by "smell," using chemical receptors, and then suck their prey in like a vacuum.`,
      `In the wild, they are critically endangered and only found in Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City.`,
      `They have very simple, cartilage-based skeletons.`,
      `Wild axolotls are dark and mottled; the pink and white ones are bred in captivity.`,

    name: 'Goblin Shark',
    facts: [
      `The Goblin Shark is called a "living fossil" because it's the last member of a 125-million-year-old family.`,
      `Its long, flat snout is covered in "ampullae of Lorenzini," special sensors that detect the electric fields of prey.`,
      `Its jaws are "protrusible," meaning they can shoot forward, like a slingshot, to catch fish.`,
      `This "slingshot" jaw is the fastest-known jaw mechanism of any shark.`,
      `Their pinkish skin is so thin and transparent that you are actually seeing their blood vessels underneath.`,
      `They live in total darkness in the deep sea, as far down as 4,000 feet (1,200 meters).`,
      `Because they live so deep, their muscles are flabby and they are very slow, sluggish swimmers.`,
      `Their teeth are long, thin, and needle-like, perfect for grasping slippery, deep-sea squid and fish.`,
      `A Goblin Shark was once found in the stomach of a giant deep-sea "ship worm" (a type of clam).`,
      `Despite their terrifying look, they are no threat to humans, as they live far too deep.`

    name: 'Pangolin',
    facts: [
      `Pangolins are the only mammals in the world completely covered in scales.`,
      `Their scales are made of keratin, the exact same material as your fingernails and hair.`,
      `When threatened, they roll into an armor-plated ball so tight that even a lion can't open it.`,
      `They have no teeth and "chew" their food using small, gravelly stones in their stomach.`,
      `Their tongue can be over 16 inches long—longer than their entire body—and is stored in a special chest cavity.`,
      `A single pangolin can eat up to 20,000 ants and termites in one night.`,
      `They can close their nostrils and ears completely to stop ants from crawling inside.`,
      `Pangolins are, sadly, the most illegally trafficked mammals in the world.`,
      `Baby pangolins ride on their mother's back by holding onto her scales.`,
      `Some species, like the Black-bellied pangolin, have a prehensile (grasping) tail to hang from trees.`

    name: 'Okapi',
    facts: [
      `The Okapi is the only living relative of the giraffe, not the zebra.`,
      `Its stripes are for camouflage in the dense, filtered sunlight of the rainforest.`,
      `It has a prehensile (grasping) tongue that is 14-18 inches long—long enough to clean its own eyelids and ears!`,
      `Okapis have scent glands on their feet that leave behind a sticky, tar-like substance to mark their territory.`,
      `They are so shy and elusive that they were unknown to Western science until 1901.`,
      `They can rotate their ears independently to listen for sounds in two different directions at once.`,
      `Okapis are "solitary," meaning they live alone, only meeting up to mate.`,

    name: 'Komodo Dragon',
    facts: [
      `Komodo dragons are the largest and heaviest lizards on Earth.`,
      `They are "ambush predators" and will wait for days for suitable prey to pass by.`,
      `They have a "venomous" bite that contains a mix of toxic proteins, not just bacteria.`,
      `This venom stops the prey's blood from clotting and causes it to go into shock.`,
      `A Komodo dragon can eat 80% of its own body weight in a single meal.`,
      `They have a special joint in their jaw (intramandibular hinge) that allows them to swallow huge chunks of meat.`,
      `They "taste" the air with their forked tongue, using an organ in their mouth called the Jacobson's organ.`,
      `Young Komodo dragons roll in feces (poop) to smell bad so adult dragons won't eat them!`,
      `Females can reproduce through "parthenogenesis," meaning they can have babies without a male.`,
      `They can see in color and have vision as good as a human's.`

  {
    name: 'Narwhal',
    facts: [
      `The narwhal's "tusk" is actually a single, 10-foot-long tooth that spirals out of its upper lip.`,
      `This tusk is a sensory organ with over 10 million nerve endings inside, used to "read" the water.`,
      `They use the tusk to detect changes in water temperature, pressure, and even the saltiness of the water.`,
      `Some narwhals (about 1 in 500) can grow two tusks!`,
      `Unlike our teeth, the narwhal tusk is hard on the inside and soft on the outside.`,
      `Narwhals are deep divers, capable of reaching depths of over 5,000 feet (1,500 meters).`,
      `They are related to beluga whales and, like them, live in the Arctic year-round.`,
      `Scientists have seen them using their tusks to tap and "stun" fish before eating them.`,
      `The tusk is almost always found on males, but about 15% of females can also grow a (smaller) tusk.`,
      `They have no dorsal fin (fin on their back), which makes it easier to swim under large sheets of ice.`

  {
    name: 'Platypus',
    facts: [
      `The platypus is a "monotreme," a rare type of mammal that lays eggs instead of giving live birth.`,
      `It has a "sixth sense": its rubbery bill is covered in 40,000 electroreceptors to detect the electric fields of prey.`,
      `Male platypuses have a hollow, venomous spur on their back ankles.`,
      `The venom is strong enough to cause extreme pain to a human or kill a dog-sized animal.`,
      `When they swim, they fold their eyes and ears into special grooves and are completely "blind" and "deaf" underwater.`,
      `The first scientists to see a platypus specimen thought it was a fake, with a duck bill sewn onto a beaver's body.`,
      `A baby platypus is called a "puggle" and is the size of a lima bean when it hatches.`,
      `They do not have a stomach; their food goes directly from their esophagus to their intestines.`,
      `Their fur is so dense (800 hairs per square millimeter) that it traps a layer of air to keep them warm and dry.`,
      `Platypus milk seeps out of special pores in the mother's skin, and the puggles lap it up.`

  {
    name: 'Aye-Aye',
    facts: [
      `The Aye-Aye is a type of lemur from Madagascar, but it is one of a kind.`,
      `It uses a method called "percussive foraging," tapping on wood up to 8 times per second to find grub tunnels.`,
      `Its long, skeletal middle finger is on a "ball-and-socket" joint, like your shoulder, letting it swivel 360 degrees.`,
      `It uses its huge, bat-like ears to listen for the echo from its tapping to pinpoint the grub.`,
      `Once it finds a grub, it uses its sharp, rodent-like front teeth (that never stop growing!) to gnaw a hole.`,
      `Then, it inserts its skinny middle finger into the hole to hook and extract the grub.`,
      `The Aye-Aye is the world's largest nocturnal primate.`,
      `Its brain is, proportionally, very large, which it needs for its complex hunting technique.`,
      `It has a "third eyelid" (a nictitating membrane) that it can close to protect its eyes while it chews wood.`,
      `It is the only primate known to use echolocation to find its food (though it's "tapping" echolocation).`

  {
    name: 'Blobfish',
    facts: [
      `The blobfish looks "blobby" on land, but looks like a normal fish in its deep-sea home.`,
      `It lives at depths of 2,000-4,000 feet, where the pressure is over 100 times higher than at the surface.`,
      `Its body is made of a gelatinous "jelly" that is slightly less dense than water, allowing it to float effortlessly.`,
      `It has no swim bladder (the air sac most fish use to float) because the deep-sea pressure would crush it.`,
      `The blobfish has almost no muscle at all.`,
      `It is an "ambush predator" that simply floats with its mouth open, eating whatever drifts by (like deep-sea "snow").`,
      `Female blobfish lay thousands of pink eggs on the seafloor.`,
      `Blobfish are known to be "dedicated parents," with the mother or father sitting on the eggs to protect them.`,
      `They were "discovered" by accident when they were dragged up in deep-sea trawling nets.`,
      `Its sad, "grumpy" face is just an accident of decompression (being brought up too fast).`

  {
    name: 'Dumbo Octopus',
    facts: [
      `Dumbo octopuses are named for the two large, ear-like fins on their "head" (which is really their body).`,
      `They live in the "abyssopelagic zone," or the Abyss, at depths of 9,800 to 13,000 feet!`,
      `They "fly" through the dark water by flapping their ear-like fins, not by using their tentacles.`,
      `Unlike most octopuses, they do not have an ink sac, as ink would be useless in total darkness.`,
      `They swallow their prey (like worms and tiny crustaceans) whole.`,
      `Their "arms" are all connected by a web of skin, making them look like an umbrella when spread.`,
      `They come in many colors, and some are "bioluminescent," meaning they can glow in the dark.`,
      `Females can store a male's sperm for long periods and lay eggs whenever they find a good spot.`,
      `They are part of the "cirrate" octopuses, which have small, hair-like strands called "cirri" on their arms.`,
      `The largest Dumbo octopus ever found was over 5 feet 10 inches long!`

    name: 'Star-Nosed Mole',
    facts: [
      `The "star" is an organ with 22 fleshy, pink "rays" or tentacles at the end of its snout.`,
      `This star is one of the most sensitive touch organs in the animal kingdom, with 100,000 nerve fibers.`,
      `It can "see" its world by touching it, identifying and eating prey in as fast as 120 milliseconds.`,
      `The Star-Nosed Mole is the fastest-eating mammal on Earth.`,
      `It can smell underwater by blowing air bubbles at an object and then sucking the bubbles back into its nose.`,
      `The "star" has a tiny "touch fovea" in the center, which it uses for high-detail scanning, just like we use our eyes.`,
      `It is "functionally blind," meaning its eyes are almost useless and can only detect light from dark.`,
      `They are active 24/7, day and night, and even tunnel through snow in the winter.`,
      `It can store fat in its tail, making it swell up to 4 times its normal size to survive winter.`,
      `They are fantastic swimmers and hunt for aquatic insects and small fish in ponds and marshes.`

    name: 'Yeti Crab',
    facts: [
      `Yeti crabs (Kiwa hirsuta) were only discovered in 2005.`,
      `They live in total darkness near "hydrothermal vents"—hot-water volcanoes—at the bottom of the ocean.`,
      `They are "blind" and have only the "vestiges," or remnants, of eyes.`,
      `Their "hairy" arms are covered in "setae" (bristles) that they use to "farm" bacteria.`,
      `They wave their arms in the mineral-rich water from the vents to cultivate their bacteria gardens.`,
      `Their main food source is the bacteria they "comb" off their own arms.`,
      `The bacteria on their arms also helps them "detoxify" the poisonous minerals coming from the vents.`,
      `Their family name, Kiwa, is the name of the goddess of shellfish in Polynesian mythology.`,
      `They are about 6 inches long and are a pale, ghost-like white.`,

    facts: [
      `The male's large, fleshy nose (or "proboscis") is used as an "echo chamber" to make loud honking calls.`,
      `A bigger nose is more attractive to females and helps intimidate rival males.`,
      `They are the most skilled swimmers of any primate, with partially webbed feet and hands.`,
      `They are known to "belly flop" into the water from trees to escape predators.`,
      `They have a complex, "sacculated" stomach with multiple chambers, like a cow, to digest tough, unripe leaves.`,
      `They cannot eat ripe fruit; the sugars would ferment in their special stomach and cause deadly bloating.`,
      `They live only on the island of Borneo in mangrove and river-side forests.`,

    name: 'Saiga Antelope',
    facts: [
      `The Saiga is a "living fossil" that has lived on Earth since the Ice Age, alongside woolly mammoths.`,
      `Its huge, trunk-like nose is a "portable air conditioner," warming up frigid winter air and filtering dust in summer.`,
      `During mating season, the male's nose swells up and he "roars" through it to attract females.`,
      `They are critically endangered, having lost over 95% of their population in just 15 years.`,
      `A baby Saiga (a calf) can run almost as fast as an adult just one day after being born.`,
      `They are "nomadic," migrating hundreds of miles across the flat, open steppes of Central Asia.`,
      `Only the males have horns, which are prized in traditional medicine, leading to poaching.`,
      `In 2015, a mysterious disease wiped out over 200,000 Saiga (60% of the *entire* world population) in just 3 weeks.`,
      `Their eyes are on the sides of their heads, giving them a 320-degree field of vision to spot predators.`,

    facts: [
      `The Maned Wolf is not a wolf or a fox, and it is the only member of its own genus, *Chrysocyon*.`,
      `Its long, stilt-like legs are an adaptation for seeing over the tall grasses of the South American savanna.`,
      `Over 50% of its diet is a fruit called the "wolf apple," which looks like a tomato.`,
      `They have a "symbiotic" relationship with the wolf apple: the wolf eats it, and the fruit helps the wolf (with health), and the wolf spreads its seeds.`,
